# IoT Enabled System for Proactive Health Prediction
## Project Description
GaitMonitoring is an innovative Android application engineered for the proactive health monitoring and prediction of gait dynamics using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The core functionality revolves around the use of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), particularly the Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840, which captures gyroscope data and communicates via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to the Android device. This data is essential for a variety of analyses such as fall detection, step counting, and an in-depth evaluation of gait health, enhancing our understanding and ability to predict potential health issues. Additionally, the application supports data visualization and cloud uploads, ensuring that the information is accessible for continuous monitoring and historical analysis.

The application is built in Kotlin using Android Studio and utilizes Jetpack Compose for a modern, efficient user interface design and Dagger for robust dependency injection. For data management and cloud-based operations, GaitMonitoring integrates Google's Firebase, leveraging its Firestore database for real-time data handling and storage. The app's architecture not only facilitates real-time data transfer and processing but also lays the groundwork for future enhancements such as the incorporation of machine learning models for predictive analytics. This setup ensures that developers and researchers can continue to build upon a solid foundation, focusing on enhancing the application's capabilities to meet the evolving needs of proactive health monitoring.
