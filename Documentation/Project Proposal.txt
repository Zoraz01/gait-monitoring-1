CMSC451 - CS24-602  IoT Enabled Gait Monitoring System for Proactive Health Monitoring and Prediction Project Proposal

Problem Statement
	
Design and develop an integrated health monitoring ecosystem centered around a 3D-printed wearable device retrofitted with Bluetooth connectivity and specialized sensors. This wearable device is dedicated to gait analysis, utilizing sensors to collect and transmit data to a mobile application via Bluetooth technology. The mobile application serves as a user interface for real-time gait analysis, while the collected data is securely processed and analyzed in the cloud using machine learning algorithms.
The primary objective of this project is to create a comprehensive solution that enables users to monitor their gait patterns, collect health-related data, and receive predictive insights. By leveraging cloud-based data processing and machine learning models, the system will provide valuable feedback and recommendations based on the user's gait data, empowering individuals to proactively manage their health and well-being.


Business and Functional Requirements
ECE team will be working on cleaning and refining hardware aspects of the shank mounted system and instrumented cane.
The CS team will work on an app that can collect data and provide some basic feedback/summary and then push all raw data to a cloud based system.
The shank mounted system will prove movement (gyroscope) and EMG data. Instrumented cane will provide movement (gyroscope) and loading data. We should target a higher sampling frequency (200 Hz or 250 Hz).
Shank mounted system should target at least the main muscle in the leg (Gastrocnemius and/ Soleus). We want to target the muscle that provides the best data about EMG during the gait cycle. 
The ECE team might need to improve existing shank mounted 3D design as well as cane 3D design to hold an amplifier, and a rechargeable battery. 
The CS team should advise/decide we need to use BLE or Bluetooth for wireless communication.
We are going to target if we can publish a paper resulting from the project. 
The CS team will work on an algorithm to segment gait data.
